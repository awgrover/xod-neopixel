XOD library for controlling single-wire-based LED pixels and strip ("Neopixels").

Mechanically converted by https://forum.xod.io/u/awgrover using github.com:awgrover/arduino-2-xod from:
Adafruit NeoPixel (Adafruit_NeoPixel) by Adafruit. Version 1.1.7. I think this is working with the version 1.10.4, and should work with later 1.x versions.
https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPixel

With some examples, and XOD utility nodes (like "if-else", "equal", etc.).

Install using the standard XOD library installation process. This library is published as: awgrover/adafruitneopixel ( https://xod.io/libs/awgrover/adafruitneopixel/ ). There are a couple of other XOD neopixel libraries written by other people.

Look at the Adafruit tutorials (for "Arduino", not CircuitPython). Each node in this library is from the Adafruit library, so look for the same node-name as you see in the Arduino code examples. Also look at the Adafruit examples (https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPixel/tree/master/examples), which you'll have to translate to XOD style (again, the methods should have the same name as the nodes in this library). I did translate "example simple", so try to use that as a guide.

I provided a "color-order" node to configure the RGB order (the "t" input). It is probably easier to use than the "NEO_..." values in the Adafruit examples.

To get started:

Start a project and then:
* If you have at least 3 neopixels, right-click on `example-rgb-revelation` and "clone to my project".
* If you have less than 3 neopixels, right-click on 'example-rgb-revelation1pixel` and "clone to my project".

Then read the comments and make adjustments as directed.

I have a fairly decent record of responding on the XOD forums: https://forum.xod.io
